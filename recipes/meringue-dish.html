        <h1>Meringue Bones and Ghosts</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            While I know no one is ever actually scared by spooky Halloween treats, 
            I do know for a fact that many people are terrified to work with meringue. 
            Hopefully these bones and ghosts will help chase those demons away.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 large egg whites</li>
            <li>2 drops of fresh lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
            <li>7 tablespoon white sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 chocolate chips, melted, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). 
                Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk eggs whites and lemon juice together in a bowl until thick, white, and foamy. 
                Add sugar a spoonful at a time, whisking constantly, 
                until meringue is shiny, thick, and holds its shape.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer meringue to a piping bag. Pipe 12 bone shapes onto a prepared baking sheet. 
                Pipe 12 puffs to resemble ghosts onto the remaining baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until dried and firm, about 1 hour. 
                Turn off the oven, close the door, and cool until completely dried, about 1 hour more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dip the tip of a toothpick into melted chocolate 
                and dot chocolate "eyes" on each of the ghosts.
            </li>
        </ol>
